# Sleep-Efficiency-Regression
Building a multiple linear regression model in R for sleep efficiency data. Model choice was found through stepwise searching and using R-squared adjusted values, AIC, BIC, and Mallow's  CP criterion. Interaction and higher order terms were also investigated in the model. We then compared the model to my actual data to test predictive power.
